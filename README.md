# Mana Toolkit - Module for the WiFi Pineapples  
===================================
This is an early BETA release of the Mana Toolkit "Module" for the WiFi Pineapples made by me. @adde88  
It does work, on both Pineapple NANO and TETRA.  But i do not feel that it's ready yet to be submitted to the Hak5 repositories.    
I would be very happy if people have suggestions or general feedback for improving the Module.  

Installation:
-----------------
Create folder: /pineapple/modules/ManaToolkit  
Copy all files to said folder.  
Done.   

Disclaimer
----------
I did NOT make the MANA patches for hostapd! All creds. to Sensepost for that work!    
About this port: I drew inspiration from TarlogicSecurity, who successfully ported hostapd-wpe to OpenWRT.  
You do not need to touch this repo. to install anything! It's simply used as a source-repo. when building the whole thing.
